`AggregateContainerState` implements the `ContainerStateAggregatorInterface`.
```go
// ContainerStateAggregator is an interface for objects that consume and
// aggregate container usage samples.
type ContainerStateAggregator interface {
	// AddSample aggregates a single usage sample.
	AddSample(sample *ContainerUsageSample)
	// SubtractSample removes a single usage sample. The subtracted sample
	// should be equal to some sample that was aggregated with AddSample()
	// in the past.
	SubtractSample(sample *ContainerUsageSample)
	// GetLastRecommendation returns last recommendation calculated for this
	// aggregator.
	GetLastRecommendation() corev1.ResourceList
	// NeedsRecommendation returns true if this aggregator should have
	// a recommendation calculated.
	NeedsRecommendation() bool
	// GetUpdateMode returns the update mode of VPA controlling this aggregator,
	// nil if aggregator is not autoscaled.
	GetUpdateMode() *vpa_types.UpdateMode
}
```


```go
// ContainerState stores information about a single container instance.
// Each ContainerState has a pointer to the aggregation that is used for
// aggregating its usage samples.
// It holds the recent history of CPU and memory utilization.
//   Note: samples are added to intervals based on their start timestamps.
